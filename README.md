# Sentiment_Analysis
## This analysis has been done using NLTK and Tensorflow using deep neural network.

I have done this analysis in two parts-

1)Creating feature sentiments using NLTK.

2)Applying that sentiments in the Neural Network using Tensorflow.

As deep neural network need lots of data for better results this model is giving me an accuracy of approx 60%, which is understandable as i have lesser data to train on.
